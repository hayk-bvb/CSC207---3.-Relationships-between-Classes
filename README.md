## Instructions

There are tasks to be done across all of the files in `src/main/java`. We recommend doing
them in the order:

1. `Bag.java`
2. `HandBag.java`
3. `CrossbodyBag.java`
4. `BagMain.java`

There are instructions at the top of each file along with TODOs.

This exercise will be submitted on **MarkUs** rather than GitHub: this will force you
to use Git properly (as opposed to the GitHub UI)!

### Git and MarkUs
On MarkUs, go to the `github-3` assignment. On the right side, you should see a section
labelled **Group repository URL**. Copy the URL: this is the repository that you'll
want to clone.

If you're using IntelliJ, the steps are as follows:

1. Create a New Project from Version Control
2. Enter the Group repository URL from this field
3. When prompted for credentials, input your MarkUs credentials

If you can't log in or can't remember your password for MarkUs, go to 
https://www.teach.cs.toronto.edu/resources/cdf_account_management.html 
to set up your account/reset your password. 
The password here is **not** the same as your general UofT password!

After cloning the repository, you should be able to see various folders.
Go to the `github-3` folder and add `Bag.java`, `HandBag.java`, `CrossbodyBag.java`,
and `BagMain.java` to it, commit your changes, and push them. You should
be able to see the files when you go to MarkUs in the Submissions tab.

You should NOT add any other files, nor have them nested in any other folders!

After you've verified your submission, go to the **Automated Testing** tab.
You may run the tests there: you may run the tests up to 10 times per hour.
These tests are exactly the same as the ones in the `src/test/java` folder.
If they pass, then you'll know you submitted your files correctly!

### Readings
For this exercise, you will want to read through **Chapter 3: Relationships between Classes**.

The earlier readings (Chapter 1 and Chapter 2) may also prove to be helpful. 

### IntelliJ Reminders
Make sure you set the folder `java` under `src/main` as Sources Root in order to
get hints from IntelliJ. Similarly, you can set the folder `java` under `src/test` as
Test Sources Root in order to run the tests we've provided.
